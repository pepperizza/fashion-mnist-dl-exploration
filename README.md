# fashion-mnist-dl-exploration

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive set of deep learning exercises using the Fashion MNIST dataset. These exercises explore key concepts in modern neural network training, from convolutional architectures to optimization algorithms, regularization techniques, and batch processing strategies.

## Dataset
Fashion MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article images, designed as a drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset. It shares the same image size, structure of training and testing splits, and serves as a more challenging classification task.
Dataset Characteristics:

Images: 70,000 grayscale images

Resolution: 28x28 pixels

Classes: 10 fashion categories

Training Set: 60,000 images

Test Set: 10,000 images

Fashion Categories:
T-shirt/top
Trouser
Pullover
Dress
Coat
Sandal
Shirt
Sneaker
Bag
Ankle boot

## Implemented Techniques
Basic ConvNet architecture design:
- Comparison of different architectures (shallow vs. deep)
- Early stopping approach

Optimization Algorithms:
- SGD with Momentum
- Nesterov Momentum
- Adam optimizer

Regularization Techniques:
- L2 regularization (Ridge)
- Combined L1 (Lasso) and L2

Batch Strategies:
- Full batch gradient descent
- Stochastic gradient descent
- Mini-batch gradient descent

## Prerequisites
